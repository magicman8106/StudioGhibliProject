<h2>Studio Ghibli Project</h2>
<p>This was an introductory project I created to learn html/css and basic JavaScript.
</br>
The javaScript file calls on the StudioGhibli API and gets all of the movie titles and their description. Then displaying the information in seperate containers.
</br>
Not interactive really or very interesting more of a lesson than a project.
</br>
Favorite Studio Ghibli Movie: Princess Mononoke.
